            Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can equally
            perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and
            tools. It also means that they can contribute equally without
            barriers. Accessibility is the concept of whether a product or
            service can be used by everyone or not. Accessibility laws exist to
            aid people with disabilities, but designers should try to
            accommodate all potential users in many contexts of use anyway. To
            do so has firm benefitsâ€”notably better designs for all. The
            Accessibility Checker verifies your file against a set of rules that
            identify possible issues for people who have disabilities or also
            for normal people. Depending on how severe the issue is, the
            Accessibility Checker classifies each issue as an error, warning, or
            tip. The main objective of Accessibility Checker is a product or
            service can be used by everyone. It makes websites more accessible
            to all kind of user
